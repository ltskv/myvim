# My settings for VIM

## Usage

If you find yourself wanting to use these settings, do the following:

```
colors -> ~/.vim/colors
ftplugin -> ~/.vim/ftplugin
.vimrc -> ~/.vimrc
```

Also create two files `~/.vim/plugins.vim` and `~/.vim/locals.vim`. The first
one contains commands for your plugin manager and in the second one are commands
that are local to the machine. You might use `plugin_template.vim` and
`locals_template.vim` for reference.
